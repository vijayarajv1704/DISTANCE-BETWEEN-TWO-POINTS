# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get two value from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Assign the value is temporary variable to the first variable
### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchange
### step 6:
End point
```
### PROGRAM:
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: 
#RegisterNumber:
import math
l1 = [4,2]
l2 =[10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
